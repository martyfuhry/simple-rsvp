## The Rule of Saint Benedict

> _“Let all guests who arrive be received like Christ.”_ — Rule of St. Benedict, Chapter 53

This project is governed by **the Rule of Saint Benedict**, insofar as it applies to open source software.

You are expected to:

- Work diligently, humbly, and in order
- Prefer silence to needless chatter
- Offer hospitality to others, especially newcomers
- Take correction graciously; give it only with charity
- Obey the maintainer as abbot, unless they err gravely

Trolls, prideful disputants, and schismatics will be quietly removed.

Pax.
