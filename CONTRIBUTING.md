## 🕊 Guiding Principles

- **Simplicity is a feature.** Avoid complexity unless it truly serves the user.
- **No bloat.** If it feels like a platform, it's too much.
- **Local-first, self-hosted, no external dependencies.**
- **This is for normal people.** Grandma should be able to RSVP with no training.
